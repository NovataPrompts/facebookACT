# assumes emissions cost to manufacture 1 kg of 1 uF capacitors
# the numbers here represent one carbon intensity profile
# we expect that the manufacturing for passives does not change dramatically over time
# model values are provided in units of MJ equivalent per kg of manufactured components

# multilayer ceramic capacitor
mlcc: 6862 MJ / kg

# tantalum electrolytic capacitor
tec: 5567 MJ / kg
