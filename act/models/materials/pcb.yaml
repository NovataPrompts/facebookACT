# PCB materials model
# data for PCB emissions is not well-documented and sparse so this model is best effort based on the limited publicly available information
# based on data from https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/lca/13/3/13_256/_pdf/-char/en
# to get an area estimate by layer, we take the weighted average of the GHG emissions / area for each PCB datapoint provided in Table 4
# it should be noted that the 8-layer PCB is likely an outlier due to the limited number of samples in the paper
2 : 0.41 kg / m2
4 : 0.43 kg / m2
6 : 0.71 kg / m2
8 : 0.91 kg / m2

# also provide the weighted average carbon per area per layer of the GHG-CO2-eq to interpolate the higher layers
# assumes zero intercept linear model for now in lieu of a better model and more data
cpla : 0.13 kg / m2
